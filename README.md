## Overview

This repository contains NER datasets and resources for the following languages:

* Urdu
* Shahmukhi / Punjabi
* Sindhi
* Pashto

The datasets are useful for research on:

* Named Entity Recognition
* Low-resource NLP
* Multilingual NLP
* Cross-lingual learning
* Data augmentation
* Token classification
* Pakistani language processing
* South Asian NLP

---

## Entity Types

The datasets contain three coarse-grained named entity types:

| Label | Meaning          |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `PER` | Person           |
| `LOC` | Location         |
| `ORG` | Organization     |
| `O`   | Non-entity token |

---

## Data Format

The datasets follow token-level BIO format.

Example:

```text
لاہور B-LOC
آرٹس I-LOC
کونسل I-LOC
نے O
پروگرام O
منعقد O
کیا O
```

Each line contains:

```text
TOKEN LABEL
```

Sentences are separated by a blank line.

## BIO Tags

| Tag     | Meaning                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `B-PER` | Beginning of a person entity        |
| `I-PER` | Inside a person entity              |
| `B-LOC` | Beginning of a location entity      |
| `I-LOC` | Inside a location entity            |
| `B-ORG` | Beginning of an organization entity |
| `I-ORG` | Inside an organization entity       |
| `O`     | Outside any named entity            |

---

## Research Background

Named Entity Recognition remains challenging for low-resource languages because of limited annotated datasets and weak representation in multilingual language models.

This repository supports research on NER for Pakistani languages by providing datasets used in experiments with multilingual and generative models such as:

* Glot500-base
* XLM-RoBERTa-large
* LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
* Mistral-7B-Instruct

The associated paper proposes a **cluster-based cross-lingual data augmentation method** for generating culturally and linguistically plausible NER training examples.

---

## Applications

These datasets can be used for:

* Named Entity Recognition
* Urdu NER
* Shahmukhi NER
* Punjabi NER
* Sindhi NER
* Pashto NER
* Multilingual NER
* Cross-lingual NER
* Low-resource NLP
* Data augmentation
* Token classification
* Few-shot NER
* Zero-shot NER
* Evaluation of multilingual LLMs
* Pakistani language processing
* South Asian computational linguistics
